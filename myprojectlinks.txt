I tried to deploy my site, it said the deployment was successful, yet a 404 page is showing. 
My site uses Gatsby and React and is static. I removed require functions in the code so it 
would not clash with me importing things: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/debugging-html-builds/. 
I also changed the name of a folder from pages to templates, as it was mentioned as a way to fix 
the issue in stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54402112/gatsby-develop-command-runs-but-gatsby-build-gives-error?rq=1. 
Also since I made these changes the when I use the gatsby build command to get the local host running, the site comes up with errors and no longer works.
