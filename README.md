# The link to my site is: https://www.may-showumi.com/ . 

This project was made using gatsby, react, framer motion, canvas, styled components and deployed via netlify.

## Required Update
1. Make the website responsive.
2. Link freelancing website.
3. Update with the newer projects I have been working on for other organisations.
4. Look into adding Threejs animation in the bottom as it is a bit boring
5. Make up my mind on a font to use
